            He who journeyed beyond all worlds,<br>

            He who remembered the time before the Flood,<br>

        <p class="floating-text">
            He traveled beyond the edges of the earth,<br>
            and carved his story in stone for all to see.

        <p class="center-text">
            He built Uruk, crowned with shining walls,<br>
            and raised the temple of Eanna for the goddess Ishtar.

        <p class="floating-text-2">
            The Seven Sages laid the city's foundations,<br>

        <p class="bottom-right-text">
            In a copper-bound box he hid his tale,<br>
            waiting for those who would open its bronze clasp.

        <p class="floating-text-3">
            Two-thirds divine, one-third mortal—<br>

            The gods cried out to Aruru:<br>
            "Shape a rival to the stormy heart of Gilgamesh!"
        </p>
    
        <p class="creation-text-1">
            From the clay of the wilderness<br>
            and the silence between stars,<br>
            Aruru shaped a being of might and wildness. <br>
            Hair covered his body like the fields of Ashnan,<br>
            his locks flowed like ripened grain.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="creation-text-1-below">
            He knew neither city nor the speech of men,<br>
            but lived with gazelles upon the open plain,<br>
            drank with the beasts at the watering hole.<br>
            His body, mighty and unshorn,<br>
            his spirit born of the gods of strength.

        <p class="creation-text-2">
            For three days the trapper saw him,<br>

        <p class="creation-text-2-below">
            "Father!" he cried, "There roams a mighty one,<br>
            strong as the stone from the heavens.
            He fills in my pits, tears out my traps,<br>
            and frees the beasts from my grasp!"

            <p>
                "Go, my son," the father said,<br>
                "To Uruk, where Gilgamesh rules the world of men."
            </p>
      
            <p>
                "Tell him of the wild one who roams the mountains,<br>
                strong as the stone of heaven itself."
            </p>
      
            <p>
                Gilgamesh will send the sacred harlot, Shamhat,<br>
                whose beauty is a force no beast can withstand.
            </p>
      
            <p>
                "When the animals drink at the water’s edge,<br>
                let her cast off her robe,<br>
                let her reveal the mystery of her body,<br>
                and he will be drawn from the wild forever."
            </p>
      
            <p>
                The trapper raced to Uruk,<br>
                and stood trembling before mighty Gilgamesh.
            </p>
      
            <p>
                "There is a being of the mountains," he cried,<br>
                "Strong as a meteor fallen from Anu's hand!"
            </p>
      
            <p>
                Gilgamesh answered:<br>
                "Go. Bring Shamhat.<br>
                At the watering place, she will unveil herself,<br>
                and the wild man will be caught by her gaze."

                So the trapper and Shamhat set out,<br>
                walking for three days into the silent wilds.
            </p>
      
            <p>
                At the watering hole they waited,<br>
                as the beasts came to slake their thirst.
            </p>
      
            <p>
                And with them came Enkidu,<br>
                child of the mountains,<br>
                who ate with gazelles<br>
                and drank where the lions drank.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then Shamhat beheld him —<br>
                wild, untamed, born of the wilderness.<br><br>
                
                "Unclasp your robe," they said,<br>
                "Let him see your beauty,<br>
                draw him from the beasts to you."<br><br>
                
                She bared her body without fear,<br>
                and Enkidu, drawn by her scent and sight,<br>
                forgot the wild and came into her arms.
